// NOTES //
pipe_cage_001_tx512_alpha.png is an alternate texture file that can be used to set transparency in the alpha channel of model textures. Depending on what 3D program or game engine you use the method for setting this will be different and one or the other of the texture files may be needed. The model provided in the repo is currently set to use pipe_cage_001_tx512.png.
